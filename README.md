# PEV-SimApp
I have modified the source code from MIT's PEV-SimApp. This is a simulation of Shared Autonomous Vehicle (SAV) Deployment. I also analyzed the efficacy of using PEV's in NY as well as the optimal charging stations based on historal taxi data. To learn more about the project see this presentation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BphcKWE_Wd2vqIN4zsmEgfAA5DX3Dy8SrJm31aZcW9o/edit?usp=sharing

## What is a Persuasive Electric Veheicle (PEV)?
PEV are lightweight, ride-sharing vehicles that help deliver both passengers and packages.

To read more about PEV's, see this: https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/pev/overview/
